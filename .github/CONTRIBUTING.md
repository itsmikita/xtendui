## Pull requests

**Ask first before starting work on any significant new features. There's a issue template for that "Feature or Pull Request"**.

## Formatting

Check and fix code formatting.

```sh
npm run lint --fix
```

## Automatic testing

Until we have javascript tests don't make complex javascript code changes.

<!--
Check if your code passes the automatic testing.

```sh
npm run test
