<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Theming styles are defined inside <code>/dist/theme/</code>.</p>

<p><strong>You can remove or add new classes depending on your needs</strong>, and inside the classes you can override
  css as you wish.</p>

<p>The files inside <code>/dist/core/</code> are core styles that shouldn't be modified. They are separated to keep the
  theming files shorter and cleaner.</p>

<h2>Component</h2>

<h3>Button</h3>

<p>After <code>// styles</code> you set shared styles, like font or border, after <code>// options</code> you set the
  <strong>default options</strong> for buttons, like size or special.</p>
