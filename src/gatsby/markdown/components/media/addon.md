Use this code to create a **iframe lazy that loads on click**.

Just change `iframe[data-src]` and `img[src]` attributes of the iframe and image with the content you want.

  <demoinline src="demos/components/media/iframe-lazy">
  </demoinline>

## Video Matches

Use this code to create a **video with different source for different media matches**.

Since HTML5 video doesn't support srcset or media on video sources, you can use this little script to have a **default source and different media queries on data-src source nodes**.
