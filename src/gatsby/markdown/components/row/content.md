## Anything

You can use list to space childrens like [list](/components/list/content) does. But the childrens are spaced with **padding** instead of **margin**.

<demo>
  <demovanilla src="vanilla/components/row/anything-row">
  </demovanilla>
  <demovanilla src="vanilla/components/row/anything-column">
  </demovanilla>
  <demovanilla src="vanilla/components/row/anything-nested">
  </demovanilla>
</demo>

## Columns

Refer to [Column](/components/column).
